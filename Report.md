# Task 4

1. What is the causal consistency? Explain it using the happened-before relation.
>

2. You are responsible for designing a distributed system that maintains a partial ordering of operations on a data store (for instance, maintaining a time-series log database receiving entries from multiple independent processes/sensors with minimum or no concurrency). When would you choose Lamport timestamps over vector clocks? Explain your argument. 
   What are the design objectives you can meet with both?
>

3. Vector clocks are an extension of the Lamport timestamp algorithm. However, scaling a vector clock to handle multiple processes can be challenging. Propose some solutions to this and explain your argument.
